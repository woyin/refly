### Use Case 3: Skills for Claude Code

**Goal**: Export your Refly workflows as Claude Code skills

#### Quick Start

1. **Install CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @refly-ai/refly-skills
```

2. **Export Workflow**
```bash
refly-skills export --workflow-id <your-workflow-id>
```

This generates a `.refly` skill file in the `skills/` directory.

3. **Use in Claude Code**

The exported skill is automatically available in Claude Code. Claude can now invoke your workflow as a tool!

#### Example
```bash
# Export your product research workflow
refly-skills export --workflow-id wf_product_research

# Claude Code can now use it:
User: "Research this product and analyze competitors"
Claude: [Uses product_research skill] → Returns detailed analysis
```

## Why Refly?

Most AI Agents fail in production because they rely on "Vibe-coded" scripts and fragile, black-box logic. As the ecosystem moves toward agentic frameworks like Claude Code, AutoGen, and MCP, the bottleneck is no longer the LLM—it's the lack of standardized, reliable actions.

Refly bridges the gap between raw APIs and intelligent agents. We allow you to codify messy business logic into structured, version-controlled Agent skills that any agent can invoke with 100% reliability.

**Stop hard-coding tools.** Build modular skills once in Refly's visual IDE and deploy them as MCP servers, standard APIs, or portable SDKs to any agent framework.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 🎯 Construct with Vibe (Copilot-led Builder)

Describe your business logic in natural language, and Refly's Model-Native DSL compiles your intent into a high-performance skill.

- **Intent-Driven Construction**: Describe the work once; Refly turns intent into deterministic, reusable, and composable skills.
- **Efficiency at Scale**: Streamlined DSL optimized for LLMs, ensuring fast execution and significantly lower token costs.
- **3-Minute Deployment**: Transition from a static enterprise SOP to a production-ready agent skill in under 3 minutes.

### ⚡ Execute with Control (Intervenable Runtime)

Break the "black box" of AI execution with a stateful runtime designed for deterministic reliability.

- **Intervenable Runtime**: Pause, audit, and re-steer agent logic mid-run to ensure 100% operational compliance.
- **Deterministic Guarantees**: Enforce strict business rules that minimize hallucinations and handle failure recovery.

### 🚀 Ship to Production (Unified Agent Stack)

Unify MCP integrations, tools, models, and reusable skills into a single execution layer.

- **Universal Delivery**: Export as APIs for Lovable, webhooks for Slack, or native tools for Claude Code and Cursor.
- **Stable Scheduling**: Run workflows reliably on schedule with managed execution.

### 🏛️ Govern as Assets (Skill Registry)

Transform fragile scripts into governed, shared infrastructure across your organization.

- **Central Skill Registry**: Securely manage, version, and share agent capabilities.
- **Team Workspace Collaboration**: Build together with native version control and audit logs.

## Why Teams Choose Refly

### For Builders: From Vibe to Production

Most agent tooling today falls into two categories:

- Workflow builders (n8n, Dify): Great for orchestration, but workflows are fragile, trigger-only "black boxes," and hard to reuse.
- Agent frameworks (LangChain): Powerful primitives, but require heavy engineering, manual boilerplate, and high maintenance to keep running.
Refly eliminates the friction of manual configuration, giving you the fastest path from a "vibe" to a usable agent tool. By using our Streamlined DSL, you get the speed of a GUI with the precision of code.

| Dimension | Legacy Automation <br><sub>(n8n, Dify)</sub> | Code-First SDKs <br><sub>(LangChain)</sub> | **Refly Skills** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interaction Depth** | Trigger-only <br><sub>Black box</sub> | Programmatic <br><sub>Code changes</sub> | **Intervenable runtime**<br><sub>Steer logic mid-run</sub> |
| **Construction** | Manual API wiring & JSON | Manual Python/TS boilerplate | **Copilot-led**<br><sub>Describe intent → skills generated</sub> |
| **Recovery** | Fail = restart from scratch | Debug → redeploy → rerun | **Hot-fix**<br><sub>Repair workflows during execution</sub> |
| **Portability** | Hard to reuse across environments | Framework-specific | **Export everywhere**<br><sub>To Claude Code, Cursor, Manus</sub> |
| **Deployment** | Limited function tools | Custom microservices | **Production Ready**<br><sub>Stateful, validated APIs</sub> |
### For Enterprise: Scalable Skills Governance

Workflow tools like n8n are great for basic connectivity, and frameworks like LangChain offer powerful primitives — but neither provides the governed, production-ready capability layer required for enterprise agent infrastructure.

Refly acts as the Agent skills builder, providing the governance and reliability infrastructure required to deploy AI across the entire organization.

| Enterprise Requirement | Legacy Tools <br><sub>(Workflow-first)</sub> | SDKs <br><sub>(Code-first)</sub> | **Refly (Skill OS)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Governance & Reuse** | Templates are copied and<br><sub>reconfigured per instance</sub> | No native registry<br><sub>for sharing logic</sub> | **Central skill registry**<br><sub>Versioned, shareable capability assets</sub> |
| **Operational Reliability** | Trigger-based<br><sub>limited recovery</sub> | Custom handling required | **Stateful runtime**<br><sub>With validation + failure recovery</sub> |
| **SOP Enforcement** | Workflows drift<br><sub>across copies</sub> | Depends on manual<br><sub>engineering discipline</sub> | **SOP-grade deterministic skills**<br><sub>With controlled execution</sub> |
| **Deployment** | Instance-bound workflows | Code maintained manually<br><sub>per team</sub> | **Local-first, on-prem ready**<br><sub>Open-source infrastructure</sub> |
| **Total Cost (TCO)** | Overhead grows with<br><sub>workflow complexity</sub> | High engineering<br><sub>maintenance costs</sub> | **Minimal DSL**<br><sub>Reduces token spend</sub> |
